These modules will provide iterative exposure to data science practice that progressively builds competency over two years of integrated course work. In-class experiences will be augmented with data science workshops sponsored by the ECOSCOPE training program (<a href=\\\"http://ecoscope.ubc.ca\\\">http://ecoscope.ubc.ca</a>). The principal responsibilities of the TLF include:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Co-development of data science modules that can be plugged into existing MICB courses in consultation with Dr. Steven Hallam (MICB), Statistics (STAT) and faculty course coordinators. The TLF will compile and prepare lesson plans, lecture materials, assignments and a unified data set for use across training modules. Each training module will be deployed in classroom settings by the TLF working with Dr. Hallam and a team of 4 graduate research assistants (GRAs). The TLF will coordinate, train and evaluate GRAs with input from Dr. Hallam and STAT. </p></li>\\n<li><p>Coordination and promotion of extra-curricular opportunities for student interaction. The TLF will offer extra-curricular e-Sessions during which students can interact with the TLF and GRAs.

The website will contain module materials (notes, worksheets, data sets), instructions for installing software, FAQs, calendar of e-Sessions, and video recordings from workshops produced in partnership with MICB and ECOSCOPE.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Evaluation of course material effectiveness. An evaluation committee consisting of Dr. Hallam, TLF, and faculty course coordinators will conduct an evaluation of the training modules with GRA input. The TLF will compile evaluation metrics from integrated courses and assess program effectiveness. The TLF will engage MICB, STATS and Computer Science Departments and coordinate meetings to report evaluation metrics, share ideas and consider new course development opportunities. </p></li>\\n<li><p>Exploration of research and publishing opportunities. The TLF is highly encouraged to publish aspects of this work in academic journals and to conduct independent data-driven analysis of microbiome data sets used in module development.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Applicants should hold a PhD in a relevant discipline e.g. Ecology, Microbiology, Physics, Statistics or Bioinformatics and manifest competency with R/Python; version control and other practices related to collaborative and reproducible scientific research.
